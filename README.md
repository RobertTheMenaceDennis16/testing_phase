Robert Dennis
I am a Data Analytics major that has lead over 20 web development projects. 
I will be teaching, assisting and training students full stack development all within this environment as proof of the journey. I will only assist when needed and I will provide tips and materials when entering new topics. The students will learn everything through this complete development that I will only provide the foundation for. their creativity will be what drives this page.
The students below will have been through extensive hands on with git, github, visual studio, frontend tool(html, css, javascript, react, tailwind, bootstrap) and backend tools(Flask, Django, postman), and database tools (SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy)
